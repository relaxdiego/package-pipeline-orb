# This template is a dynamic configuration that the main .circleci/config.yml
# renders and then triggers. For more information on dynamic configurations,
# see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/dynamic-config/
#
# The purpose of this config is to allow our main workflow in .circleci/config.yml
# to test each of the jobs that we define in src/jobs. In effect, this is an
# integration test for the orb that this pipeline is building.
#
# Yeah, we're using a Circle CI config to test an orb which is essentially
# a packaged, parameterized Circle CI config. :-)
